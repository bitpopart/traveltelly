## Comments

Reviews support comments using NIP-22 Comment events (`kind:1111`). Comments reference the review using the `A` tag with the review's naddr (NIP-19 addressable event identifier).

### Comment Structure

Comments on reviews follow the NIP-22 specification:

```json
{
  "kind": 1111,
  "content": "Great review! I had a similar experience there.",
  "tags": [
    ["A", "34879:pubkey:review-id"],
    ["K", "34879"],
    ["P", "review-author-pubkey"],
    ["a", "34879:pubkey:review-id"],
    ["e", "review-event-id"],
    ["k", "34879"],
    ["p", "review-author-pubkey"],
    ["alt", "Comment on review: Place Name"]
  ]
}
```

### Querying Comments

To query comments for a specific review:
```
["REQ", "review-comments", {"kinds": [1111], "#A": ["34879:pubkey:review-id"], "limit": 100}]
```

## Permission System

This application implements a permission system to control who can post reviews. Only authorized users can create review events.

### Permission Events

**Permission Request (`kind:31491`)**
Users can request permission to post reviews:

```json
{
  "kind": 31491,
  "content": "I'm a travel blogger with 5 years of experience...",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "review-permission-1234567890"],
    ["request_type", "review_permission"],
    ["alt", "Request for review posting permission"]
  ]
}
```

**Permission Grant (`kind:30383`)**
Admin can grant or block permissions:

```json
{
  "kind": 30383,
  "content": "Review posting permission granted",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "review-grant-pubkey"],
    ["grant_type", "review_permission"],
    ["p", "user-pubkey"],
    ["e", "request-event-id"],
    ["alt", "Review permission granted"]
  ]
}
```

### Admin Authority

The admin npub `npub105em547c5m5gdxslr4fp2f29jav54sxml6cpk6gda7xyvxuzmv6s84a642` has exclusive authority to:
- Grant review posting permissions
- Block permission requests
- Access the admin panel

### Permission Workflow

1. **Request**: User submits permission request with reason
2. **Review**: Admin reviews request in admin panel
3. **Decision**: Admin grants permission or blocks request
4. **Access**: Granted users can post reviews

## Lightning Zaps

Reviews can be zapped using NIP-57 Lightning Zaps. When `lightning` tag is set to "yes", the review indicates the reviewer accepts Lightning tips for their review.

```
["REQ", "reviews", {"kinds": [34879], "#t": ["cafe"], "limit": 50}]
```

To query reviews by location (using geohash):
