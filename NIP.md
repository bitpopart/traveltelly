# Nostr Review and Media Marketplace Platform Implementation

This project implements a decentralized review platform and digital media marketplace using existing Nostr NIPs with Lightning payment support and comprehensive permission systems.

## Implementation Overview

This platform leverages existing Nostr standards with minimal custom event kinds:

- **Custom Review System**: Using kind `34879` for location-based reviews
- **NIP-99 (Classified Listings)**: For digital media marketplace listings using kind `30402`
- **NIP-52 (Calendar Events)**: For event management using kinds `31922` and `31923`
- **NIP-57 (Lightning Zaps)**: For Lightning payments via Bitcoin
- **NIP-04 (Encrypted Direct Messages)**: For communication between users
- **NIP-15 (Nostr Marketplace)**: Reference implementation for marketplace message types
- **Custom Permission System**: For managing review and media upload permissions (kinds `31492`, `30384`)

## Review System (Custom Kind 34879)

Location-based reviews are published using custom kind `34879` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "kind": 34879,
  "content": "Review content and experience details",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "review-unique-id"],
    ["title", "Blue Bottle Coffee"],
    ["rating", "5"],
    ["category", "cafe"],
    ["location", "123 Main St, San Francisco, CA"],
    ["g", "geohash-encoded-location"],
    ["image", "photo_url"],
    ["alt", "Review of Blue Bottle Coffee - 5 stars"]
  ]
}
```

## Digital Media Marketplace (NIP-99)

Digital media assets are published as NIP-99 classified listings (kind `30402`) with the following required tags:

```json
{
  "kind": 30402,
  "content": "Digital media description and usage rights",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "media_unique_id"],
    ["title", "Sunset Over Mountains - 4K Photo"],
    ["summary", "High-resolution landscape photography"],
    ["price", "25", "USD"],
    ["t", "photos"],
    ["status", "active"],
    ["published_at", "unix_timestamp"],
    ["location", "Yosemite National Park"],
    ["image", "preview_image_url"]
  ]
}
```

### Supported Media Types

- **Photos**: High-resolution stock photography, artistic images, portraits
- **Videos**: Stock footage, animations, motion graphics, promotional videos
- **Audio**: Music tracks, sound effects, ambient audio, voice recordings
- **Graphics**: Illustrations, icons, logos, vector graphics
- **Templates**: Design templates, presentation layouts, document templates
- **3D Models**: 3D assets, textures, materials
- **Fonts**: Typography, custom fonts, font families
- **Presets**: Photo presets, video LUTs, audio effects

### Supported Currencies

- **Lightning**: `BTC`, `SATS` - Paid via NIP-57 Lightning Zaps
- **Fiat**: `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, `CAD`, `AUD` - Paid via Stripe integration

## Payment Methods

### Lightning Payments (NIP-57)

For digital media priced in `BTC` or `SATS`:

1. Buyer creates a zap request (kind `9734`) with license details
2. Payment flows through standard Lightning Network via NIP-57
3. Zap receipt (kind `9735`) serves as payment confirmation
4. Creator receives notification via Lightning wallet

### Fiat Payments (Stripe)

For digital media priced in fiat currencies:

1. Buyer initiates Stripe payment flow
2. Payment processed via Stripe API
3. Confirmation sent to creator via encrypted DM
4. Traditional payment receipt via email

## License Communication (NIP-04)

License orders are communicated via encrypted direct messages (kind `4`) following NIP-15 message structure:

```json
{
  "type": 0,
  "id": "license_unique_id",
  "name": "buyer_name",
  "message": "licensing_questions",
  "contact": {
    "nostr": "buyer_pubkey",
    "email": "buyer_email"
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "media_id": "media_unique_id",
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ],
  "payment_method": "lightning|stripe",
  "amount": 25,
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

## Security Considerations

- **Encryption**: All license details encrypted using NIP-44 (preferred) or NIP-04 (fallback)
- **Authentication**: Buyers and creators authenticated via Nostr key pairs
- **Payment Security**: Lightning payments are cryptographically secure; Stripe provides traditional payment security
- **License Delivery**: Digital files delivered via encrypted download links
- **Dispute Resolution**: Handled through direct Nostr communication between parties

## Integration Requirements

### Lightning Setup
- Creators need Lightning addresses (lud16 or lud06) in their profiles
- Buyers need Lightning wallets or WebLN extensions

### Stripe Setup
- Creators need Stripe accounts for fiat payments
- Environment variable `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` required
- Backend API endpoint `/api/create-payment-intent` needed for production

## Advantages of This Approach

1. **Standards Compliance**: Uses existing, well-tested Nostr NIPs
2. **Interoperability**: Compatible with other NIP-99 marketplace clients
3. **Dual Payment Support**: Supports both crypto and fiat payments
4. **Decentralized**: No central marketplace authority required
5. **Instant Delivery**: Digital assets delivered immediately after payment
6. **Creator Focused**: Built specifically for digital media creators
7. **Review Integration**: Combines location reviews with media marketplace

## Permission Systems

The platform implements dual permission systems for quality control:

### Review Permission System

To maintain quality and prevent spam in reviews:

#### Permission Request (Kind 31492)

Users request permission to create reviews via addressable events:

```json
{
  "kind": 31492,
  "content": "Reason for requesting review permission",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "review-permission-timestamp"],
    ["request_type", "review_permission"],
    ["experience", "Travel blogger with 3 years experience"],
    ["alt", "Request for review creation permission"]
  ]
}
```

### Media Upload Permission System

To maintain quality and prevent spam in the media marketplace:

#### Permission Request (Kind 31492)

Users request permission to upload digital media via addressable events:

```json
{
  "kind": 31492,
  "content": "Reason for requesting media upload permission",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "media-permission-timestamp"],
    ["request_type", "stock_media_permission"],
    ["portfolio", "https://photographer-portfolio.com"],
    ["experience", "Professional photographer with 5 years experience"],
    ["alt", "Request for media upload permission"]
  ]
}
```

#### Permission Grant (Kind 30384)

Admins grant permissions via replaceable events:

```json
{
  "kind": 30384,
  "content": "Media upload permission granted",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "media-grant-user_pubkey"],
    ["grant_type", "stock_media_permission"],
    ["p", "user_pubkey"],
    ["e", "original_request_id"],
    ["alt", "Media upload permission granted"]
  ]
}
```

#### Permission Blocking (Kind 30384)

Admins can block users from uploading media:

```json
{
  "kind": 30384,
  "content": "Reason for blocking",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "media-block-user_pubkey"],
    ["grant_type", "stock_media_permission_blocked"],
    ["p", "user_pubkey"],
    ["e", "original_request_id"],
    ["block_reason", "Inappropriate content"],
    ["alt", "Media upload permission blocked"]
  ]
}
```

### Admin Configuration

The system recognizes a specific admin npub: `npub105em547c5m5gdxslr4fp2f29jav54sxml6cpk6gda7xyvxuzmv6s84a642`

Only this admin can:
- Grant review creation permissions
- Grant media upload permissions
- Block permission requests
- Revoke existing permissions
- Manage review categories
- **Manage all reviews (edit/delete)**
- Access the admin panel

## Review Category Management System

The application includes a dynamic category management system for review classifications using custom Nostr events.

### Category Definition (Kind 37539)

Review categories are stored as addressable events that can be updated by administrators:

```json
{
  "kind": 37539,
  "content": "[{\"value\":\"restaurant\",\"label\":\"üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant\",\"group\":\"Food & Drink\"},{\"value\":\"hotel\",\"label\":\"üè® Hotel\",\"group\":\"Places\"}]",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "review-categories"],
    ["title", "Review Categories"],
    ["alt", "Review category definitions for the review system"]
  ]
}
```

### Category Structure

Each category object contains:
- **value**: Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
- **label**: Display name with optional emoji
- **group**: Category grouping for UI organization

### Admin Category Management

Administrators can:
- Add new categories via the admin panel
- Remove existing categories
- Organize categories into groups
- Update category labels and emojis

### Integration with Reviews

The review system (kind 34879) references categories via the `category` tag, using the category's `value` field. The CreateReviewForm dynamically loads available categories and displays them grouped by category group.

## Calendar Events System (NIP-52)

The platform implements a comprehensive calendar events system using NIP-52 standard for both date-based and time-based events.

### Date-Based Events (Kind 31922)

All-day events that span one or more full days:
